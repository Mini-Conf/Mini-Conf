S01,static/images/speakers/rumi_chunara.jpg,Algorithmic fairness and the science of health disparities,New York University,Rumi Chunara,"Dr. Rumi Chunara is an Associate Professor at New York University, jointly appointed at the Tandon School of Engineering (in Computer Science) and the School of Global Public Health (in Biostatistics/Epidemiology). Her PhD is from the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and her BSc from Caltech. Her research group focuses on developing computational and statistical approaches for acquiring, integrating and using data to improve population and public health. She is an MIT TR35, NSF Career, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges, Facebook Research and Max Planck Sabbatical award winner.","It has been shown that equalizing health disparities can avert more deaths than the number of lives saved by medical advances alone in the same time frame. Moreover, without a simultaneous focus on innovations and equity, advances in health for one group can occur at the cost of added challenges for another. In this talk I will introduce the science of health disparities and juxtapose it with the machine learning subfield of algorithmic fairness. Given the key foci and principles of health equity and health disparities within public and population health, I will show examples of how machine learning and principles of public and population health can be synergized for using data to advance the science of health disparities and sustainable health of entire populations.",,,
S02,static/images/speakers/lorin_crawford.jpg,Machine Learning for Human Genetics: A Multi-Scale View on Complex Traits and Disease,Microsoft Research New England; Brown University,Lorin Crawford,"Lorin Crawford is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research New England. He also holds a position as the RGSS Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at Brown University. His scientific research interests involve the development of novel and efficient computational methodologies to address complex problems in statistical genetics, cancer pharmacology, and radiomics (e.g., cancer imaging). Dr. Crawford has an extensive background in modeling massive data sets of high-throughput molecular information as it pertains to functional genomics and cellular-based biological processes.

Sloan Research Fellow and a David & Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship for Science and Engineering. Before joining Brown, Dr. Crawford received his PhD from the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University and received his Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from Clark Atlanta University.","A common goal in genome-wide association (GWA) studies is to characterize the relationship between genotypic and phenotypic variation. Linear models are widely used tools in GWA analyses, in part, because they provide significance measures which detail how individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are statistically associated with a trait or disease of interest. However, traditional linear regression largely ignores non-additive genetic variation, and the univariate SNP-level mapping approach has been shown to be underpowered and challenging to interpret for certain trait architectures. While machine learning (ML) methods such as neural networks are well known to account for complex data structures, these same algorithms have also been criticized as “black box” since they do not naturally carry out statistical hypothesis testing like classic linear models. This limitation has prevented ML approaches from being used for association mapping tasks in GWA applications. In this talk, we present flexible and scalable classes of Bayesian feedforward models which provide interpretable probabilistic summaries such as posterior inclusion probabilities and credible sets which allows researchers to simultaneously perform (i) fine-mapping with SNPs and (ii) enrichment analyses with SNP-sets on complex traits. While analyzing real data assayed in diverse self-identified human ancestries from the UK Biobank, the Biobank Japan, and the PAGE consortium we demonstrate that interpretable ML has the power to increase the return on investment in multi-ancestry biobanks. Furthermore, we highlight that by prioritizing biological mechanism we can identify associations that are robust across ancestries---suggesting that ML can play a key role in making personalized medicine a reality for all.",,,
S03,static/images/speakers/danielle_belgrave.jpg,Understanding Heterogeneity as a Route to Understanding Health,DeepMind,Danielle Belgrave,"Danielle Belgrave is a Senior Staff Research Scientist at DeepMind. Prior to joining DeepMind she worked in the Healthcare Intelligence group at Microsoft Research and was a tenured research fellow at Imperial College London. Her research focuses on integrating medical domain knowledge, machine learning and causal modelling frameworks to understand health. She obtained a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics from London School of Economics, an MSc in Statistics from University College London and a PhD in the area of machine learning in health applications from the University of Manchester.","Machine learning presents an opportunity to understand the patient journey over high dimensional data in the clinical context. This is aligned to one of the foundational issues of machine learning for healthcare: how do you represent a patient state. Improving state representations allows us to (i) visualise/cluster deteriorating patients, (ii) understand the patient journey and thus heterogeneous pathways to improvement or clinical deterioration which encompasses different data modalities; and thus (iii) more quickly identify situations for intervention. In this talk, I present motivating examples of understanding heterogeneity as a route towards understanding health and personalising healthcare interventions.",,,

Public health has not traditionally been a data-driven field. The good news is that has been changing in recent years, accelerated significantly by the COVID epidemic. But public health and human services organizations have many more fundamental things to worry about before we will have the luxury of considering what machine learning can enable. These fundamentals include data-related facets such as electronic data capture and exchange, data quality, data governance, information technology infrastructure, and data management best practices. In addition, data literacy, workforce development, and compensation that is a fraction of what 'quants' can earn in industry are also major stumbling blocks toward advanced analytics in public health. At the start of the COVID pandemic, many communicable diseases were reporting by fax machine and then hand-entered into a database. Although there was significant interest in predictive modeling to project hospital capacity out in the future, even the most sophisticated models were of limited use to policy makers beyond basic trends and observations from the front lines. The most notable exception, where AI is in fact proving useful in public health, is in the use of 'robotic process automation' (RPA) as a band-aid for poorly designed systems that require mindless human intervention. These tools serve as workarounds for systems that lack interoperability by emulating human users to do the grunt work of data entry and wrangling. This talk will be  a reality check from the trenches of state government on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,
