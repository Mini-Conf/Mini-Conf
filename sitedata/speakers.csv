S06,static/images/speakers/dina_demner_fushman.jpg,"Biomedical Question Answering Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow",National Institutes of Health,Dina Demner-Fushman,"Dina Demner-Fushman, MD, PhD is a Tenure Track Investigator in the Computational Health Research Branch at LHNCBC. She specializes in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, with a focus on information extraction and textual data analysis, EMR data analysis, and image and text retrieval for clinical decision support and education. Dr. Demner-Fushman's research aims to improve healthcare through the development of computational methods that can process and analyze clinical data more effectively. Her research led to the current iteration of the MEDLINE resource, which helps people navigate a plethora of NLM resources, as well as Open-i, which helps finding biomedical images.","The traditional knowledge-based approaches to question answering might seem irrelevant now that Neural QA, particularly Large Language Models show almost human performance in question answering. Knowing what was successful in the past and which elements are essential to getting the right answers, however, is needed to inform further developments in the neural approaches and help address the known shortcomings of LLMs. This talk, therefore, will provide an overview of the approaches to biomedical question answering as they were evolving. It will cover information needs of various stakeholders and the resources created to address these information needs through Question Answering.",,

S03,static/images/speakers/munmun_de_choudhury.jpg,"Bridging Machine Learning and Collaborative Action Research: A Tale Engaging with Diverse Stakeholders in Digital Mental Health",Georgia Tech,Munmun De Choudhury,"Munmun De Choudhury is an Associate Professor of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. Dr. De Choudhury is best known for laying the foundation of a new line of research that develops computational techniques towards understanding and improving mental health outcomes, through ethical analysis of social media data. To do this work, she adopts a highly interdisciplinary approach, combining social computing, machine learning, and natural language analysis with insights and theories from the social, behavioral, and health sciences. Dr. De Choudhury has been recognized with the 2023 SIGCHI Societal Impact Award, the 2022 Web Science Trust Test-of-Time Award, the 2021 ACM-W Rising Star Award, the 2019 Complex Systems Society – Junior Scientific Award, numerous best paper and honorable mention awards from the ACM and AAAI, and features and coverage in popular press like the New York Times, the NPR, and the BBC. Earlier, Dr. De Choudhury was a faculty associate with the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, a postdoc at Microsoft Research, and obtained her PhD in Computer Science from Arizona State University.","Digital traces, such as social media data, supported with advances in the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) fields, are increasingly being used to understand the mental health of individuals, communities, and populations. However, such algorithms do not exist in a vacuum -- there is an intertwined relationship between what an algorithm does and the world it exists in. Consequently, with algorithmic approaches offering promise to change the status quo in mental health for the first time since mid-20th century, interdisciplinary collaborations are paramount. But what are some paradigms of engagement for AL/ML researchers that augment existing algorithmic capabilities while minimizing the risk of harm? Adopting a social ecological lens, this talk will describe the experiences from working with different stakeholders in research initiatives relating to digital mental health – including with healthcare providers, grassroots advocacy and public health organizations, and people with the lived experience of mental illness. The talk hopes to present some lessons learned by way of these engagements, and to reflect on a path forward that empowers us to go beyond technical innovations to envisioning contributions that center humans’ needs, expectations, values, and voices within those technical artifacts.",,

She is also the director of the MIT’s Center for Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and a recipient of the MacArthur Genius Award. Professor Katabi received her PhD and MS from MIT in 2003 and 1999, and her Bachelor of Science from Damascus University in 1995. Katabi's research focuses on innovations in digital health, applied machine learning and wireless sensors and networks. Her research has been recognized with ACM Prize in Computing, the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award, two SIGCOMM Test-of-Time Awards, the Faculty Research Innovation Fellowship, a Sloan Fellowship, the NBX Career Development chair, and the NSF CAREER award. Her students received the ACM Best Doctoral Dissertation Award in Computer Science and Engineering twice. Further, her work was recognized by the IEEE William R. Bennett prize, three ACM SIGCOMM Best Paper awards, an NSDI Best Paper award and a TR10 award. Several start-ups have beenspun out of Katabi's lab such as PiCharging and Emerald.","TBD",,
S07,static/images/speakers/roxana_daneshjou.jpg,"Skin in the Game: The State of AI in Dermatology",Stanford University,Roxana Daneshjou,"Dr. Roxana Daneshjou received her undergraduate degree at Rice University in Bioengineering, where she was recognized as a Goldwater Scholar for her research. She completed her MD/PhD at Stanford, where she worked in the lab of Dr. Russ Altman. During this time, she was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Medical Scholar and a Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans Fellow.  She completed dermatology residency at Stanford in the research track and now practices dermatology as a Clinical Scholar in Stanford's Department of Dermatology while also conducting artificial intelligence research with Dr. James Zou as a postdoc in Biomedical Data Science. She is an incoming assistant professor of biomedical data science and dermatology at Stanford in Fall of 2023. Her research interests are in developing diverse datasets and fair algorithms for applications in precision medicine.","Artificial intelligence tools have been touted as having performance ""on par"" with board certified dermatologists. However, these published claims have not translated to real world practice. In this talk, I will discuss the opportunities and challenges for AI in dermatology.",,
