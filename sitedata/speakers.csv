1,static/images/speakers/m-jacobs.png,,Northwestern University,Maia Jacobs,"Dr. Maia Jacobs is an assistant professor at Northwestern University in Computer Science and Preventive Medicine. Her research contributes to the fields of Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Health Informatics through the design and evaluation of novel computing approaches that provide individuals with timely, relevant, and actionable health information. Recent projects include the design and deployment of mobile tools to increase health information access in rural communities, evaluating the influence of AI interface design on expert decision making, and co-designing intelligent decision support tools with clinicians. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Cancer Institute, and the Harvard Data Science Institute and has resulted in the deployment of tools currently being used by healthcare systems and patients around the country. She completed her PhD in Human Centered Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology and was a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard University. Jacobs’ work was awarded the iSchools Doctoral Dissertation Award, the Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing Dissertation Award, and was recognized in the 2016 report to the President of the United States from the President's Cancer Panel, which focused on improving cancer-related outcomes.",,,http://maiajacobs.com/
