R01,Human centered AI for health and wellness,Rosa Arriaga,"This research roundtable will focus on ways that AI can be incorporated into computational system design to improve health and wellness. We will discuss the hypothesis that advancing an ecological approach to data collection will lead to human-centered AI. We will also discuss the importance of intellectual diversity in computing and how this allows us to tackle a unique set of research questions.",,,2022-03-28T:23:59:00.00,,static/images/speakers/rosa_arriaga.png
R02,Social and environmental determinants of health,Esra Suel,"This research roundtable will focus on the use of emerging sources of digital data for characterising urban environmental features and exposures. For example, we will discuss monitoring of socio-economic status, housing quality, transport characteristics, and air pollution in urban areas at high spatial resolution.",,,2022-03-28T:23:59:00.00,,static/images/speakers/esra_suel.jpeg
R03,Responsible AI for health,Leo Celi,"This research roundtable will focus on the issues of fairness, biases, and ethics in AI applications for health. For example, medical knowledge systems can disproportionately represent a majoritized population (e.g., women with heart attacks have worse outcomes when cared for by male cardiologists), and in general AI models developed in the healthcare domain often exhibit bias against those who already have worse outcomes to begin with (sort of a digital divide translating in the domain of AI for Health).",,,2022-03-28T:23:59:00.00,,static/images/speakers/leo_celi.jpeg
