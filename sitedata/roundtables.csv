R01,Bridging the gap between the business of value-based care and the research of health AI,Yubin Park,"Value-Based Care (VBC) is getting its momentum. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is pushing to have all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries under a care relationship with accountability for quality and total cost of care by 2030. However, the business of VBC is more complex and is different from other businesses as it needs to satisfy three-part aims simultaneously; they are 1) better care for individuals, 2) better health for populations, and 3) lower cost. Meeting all three aims is challenging, and the details and implications of these aims are not well-known for healthcare machine learning researchers. Therefore, we want to pick a few papers from this and past years' CHIL proceedings. Then, we would like to brainstorm and discuss how those ideas in the papers can be deployed in practice, what are the barriers to the deployment/sales, what are the hidden or visible incentives for adopting such ideas, how the government and policymakers should incentivize to achieve the three-part aims of CMS while encouraging the adoption of such technologies.","Yubin Park, Ph.D., is Chief Data and Analytics Officer at Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc. (ApolloMed, NASDAQ: AMEH). He oversees value-based care analytics, remote patient monitoring, and partnerships with third-party data vendors in his current position. Yubin started his career by founding a healthcare analytics start-up after obtaining his Ph.D. degree in Machine Learning at the University of Texas at Austin in 2014. His first start-up, Accordion Health, provided an AI-driven Risk Adjustment and Quality analytics platform to Medicare Advantage plans. In 2017, Evolent Health (NYSE: EVH) acquired his company, and there, he led various clinical transformation/innovation projects. In 2020, he then founded his second start-up, Orma Health. The company built a virtual care and analytics platform for payers and providers in value-based care, e.g., Direct Contracting Entities and Accountable Care Organizations. At Orma, he worked with many sizes of risk-bearing primary care and specialty groups, helping them connect with patients through virtual care technologies. ApolloMed acquired Orma Health in 2022.",,2023-03-28T:23:59:00.00,,static/images/speakers/yubin_park.png
R02,Auditing Algorithm Performance and Equity,Alistair Johnson,"Machine learning algorithms should be easy to evaluate for performance and equity: they generate quantitative predictions that can be compared to their intended target, both in the general population and in under-served groups. But the scarcity of data means that, for most algorithms, we have no idea how they perform, and how much bias they contain. Concretely, there is no way for algorithm developers or potential users to answer the simple question: does this algorithm do what it’s supposed to do? This roundtable will focus on the opportunities and challenges of auditing algorithm performance and equity.","Dr. Johnson is a Scientist at the Hospital for Sick Children. He received his Bachelor of Biomedical and Electrical Engineering at McMaster University and successfully read for a DPhil at the University of Oxford. Dr. Johnson is most well-known for his work on the MIMIC-III Clinical database, a publicly available critical care database used by over 30,000 researchers around the world. His research focuses on the development of new database structures tailored for healthcare and machine learning algorithms for natural language processing, particularly focusing on the deidentification of free-text clinical notes.",,2023-03-28T:23:59:00.00,,static/images/speakers/alistair_johnson.jpg
