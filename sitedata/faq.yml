      - Question: How do you recommend using this site and navigating the conference?
        Answer: "All content will be accessed through this website. New content is released daily, so check the Schedule for new videos that are released, and when the live sessions for speaker Q&A and posters are taking place. You can navigate all the papers in the Papers section: you can search for keywords and authors, looking through all papers by skimming titles, or using the visualization tab at the top. We encourage everyone to visit the sponsor hall just like you would at the physical conference and then to participate in as many socials and using the chat tool. If you need any help you can ask one of the on-call helpers on the chat channel."
      - Question: What if I have a problem?
        Answer: "If you have technical difficulties, please contact us by email."

      - Question: How do I register for Rocket.Chat?
        Answer: "You will need an account for Rocket.Chat, which is the text-chat tool that is embedded throughout the site. This would have been created for you on registration. If you registered after this was done, you can request a new one, which will be approved as soon as we can. Please use the email address you used to register for the conference."
      - Question: How can I find other people to chat with during the conference?
        Answer: "The socials are one way to interact and discuss with others. We will also allow participants to make channels on RocketChat. You can create a channel about a topic, and post it to a general channel, so that others who are interested in discussing can join the channel."
