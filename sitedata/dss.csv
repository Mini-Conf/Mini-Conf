a,Doctoral Symposium Talk: Serena Jeblee,Serena Jeblee,"Serena Jeblee's (University of Toronto, Expected Aug 2020) research focuses on clinical natural language processing (NLP), with a special focus on the extraction of a normalized Cause of Death (CoD) from verbal autopsy reports. This research would be especially impactful in low to middle income countries, where verbal autopsy reports are common, and physical autopsies or medically certified causes of death are less common. Serena approaches this problem by first extracting a temporally ordered list of symptoms from the verbal autopsy report, then uses these to construct a more accurate assessment of the overall CoD diagnosis. Serena's other work focuses on other clinical NLP tasks, including automatic extraction of pertinent information from provider-patient dialogs.  ",38931967,
b,Doctoral Symposium Talk: Serifat Folorunso,Serifat Folorunso,"Dr. Serifat Folorunso's (University of Ibadan, 2019) research focuses on augmented survival data analysis using modified generalized gamma mixture cure models (GGMCMs) for cancer research.  In particular, Dr. Folorunso's work examines generalizing traditional GGMCMs to better account for the acute-asymmetry in survival data by using a gamma link function. Dr. Folorunso's model demonstrated superior performance to a traditional GGMCM as well as other kinds of survival mixture-cure models on an ovarian cancer dataset from University College Hospital, Ibadan. Dr. Folorunso's has also investigated works examining additional aspects of survival models, as well as social determinants and impacts of neonatal health.",38931968,
d,Doctoral Symposium Talk: Savannah Bergquist,Savannah Bergquist,"Dr. Savannah Bergquist's (Harvard University, 2019) research focuses on accounting for missing not at random (MNAR) data in health contexts, specifically insurance plan payment policies and lung cancer staging from insurance claims data. In the former analyses, Dr. Bergquist's work uses missingness sensitive ML methods to examine the contribution of various current practices to problematic incentives in medicare plan payment policies, and to suggest improvement. In the latter research, Dr. Bergquist focuses on predicting a clinically meaningful lung cancer staging system using classification models. Dr. Bergquist also has examined other aspects of health insurance plan design and analysis.",38931970,
e,"Paidamoyo Chapfuwa's (Duke University, Expected 2021) research focuses on bringing modern machine learning approaches to survival analysis, i.e, causal inference, generative modeling, and Bayesian nonparametric. In particular, Paidamoyo's work examines generative methods for high-performance (accurate, calibrated, uncertainty-aware predictions) survival models. Moreover, her work introduces an adversarial distribution matching approach and a novel covariate-conditional Kaplan-Meier estimator, accounting for the predictive uncertainty in survival model calibration. In  addition, her work also enables an interpretable time-to-event driven clustering method using a Bayesian nonparametric stick-breaking representation of the Dirichlet Process that represents patients in a clustered latent space. Recently,  Paidamoyo’s work has explored a unified framework for individualized treatment effect estimation for survival outcomes from observation data.",Paidamoyo Chapfuwa,"Paidamoyo Chapfuwa's (Duke University, Expected 2021) research focuses on bringing modern machine learning approaches to survival analysis, i.e, causal inference, generative modeling, and Bayesian nonparametric.

h,Doctoral Symposium Talk: Jill Furzer,Jill Furzer,"Jill Furzer's (University of Toronto, Expected 2020) research focuses on combining ensemble learning methods with an economics causal inference tool-kit to predict mental health risk in childhood, assess drivers of marginal misdiagnosis, and understand long-term socioeconomic implications of missed, late or low-value diagnoses. Jill compares classic regression with regularized regression and gradient boosted trees to estimate latent mental health risk in childhood in a nationally representative longitudinal health survey dataset, and further examines how sensitive these models are to protected subgroup information, including gender, rural v. urban, and socioeconomic status. Jill's past research has further focused on modelling the cost-effectiveness of various pediatric oncology screening guidelines and treatments.",38931974,
j,Doctoral Symposium Talk: Hasna Njah,Hasna Njah,"Dr. Hasna Njah's (University of Sfax, 2019) research focuses on learning bayesian networks (BNs) for health applications in the context of high-dimensional data. In particular, Dr. Njah's research proposes a new kind of BN, called a Bayesian Network Abstraction (BNA) framework, which uses latent variables to ameliorate the computational and optimization difficulties imposed by high-dimensional data. The BNA framework first uses dependency-based feature clustering algorithms to cluster input variables, followed by learning to summarize each cluster in a separate latent variable, thereby realizing the entire network in a hierarchical clustering & summarization BN, with the overall system learned using the greedy equilibrium criteria and hierarchical expectation maximization. In other work, Dr. Njah has focused on applying BNs to protein-protein interaction data and gene regulatory networks. ",38931976,

q,Doctoral Symposium Talk: Rohit Bhattacharya,Rohit Bhattacharya,"Rohit Bhattacharya's (Johns Hopkins University, Expected 2021) research focuses on the development of causal methods that correct for understudied but ubiquitous sources of bias that arise during the course of data analyses, including data dependence, non-ignorable missingness, and model misspecification, in the study of infectious diseases. Rohit approaches these problems by developing novel graphical modeling techniques that can detect and correct for such sources of bias while providing the investigator with clear and interpretable representations of the underlying data dependence or missingness process. In dealing with model misspecification, Rohit has recently developed algorithms that yield doubly robust and efficient semi-parametric estimators for a wide class of causal graphical models, despite the presence of unmeasured confounders. In other work, Rohit has performed several investigations in oncology applications.",38931983,
r,Doctoral Symposium Talk: Kaspar Märtens,Kaspar Märtens,"Kaspar Märtens's (University of Oxford, Expected 2020) research focuses on enabling feature-level interpretability in non-linear latent variable models via a synthesis of statistical and machine learning techniques. In particular, Kaspar designs novel latent variable, non-linear dimensionality reduction models that allow for feature-level interpretability, focusing primarily on gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), specifically augmenting these models with ideas from classical statistics, such as the functional analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition or probabilistic clustering algorithms. The results of these works are a class of models for flexible non-linear dimensionality reduction together with explainability, providing a mechanism to gain insights into what the model has learnt in terms of the observed features. In other work, Kaspar has examined genomic problems and applications of MCMC sampling.",38931984,
