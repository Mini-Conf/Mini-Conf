1,Offline Reinforcement Learning,Guy Tennenholtz,"Guy Tennenholtz is a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Technion University, advised by Prof. Shie Mannor. His research interests lie in the field of reinforcement learning, and specifically, how offline data can be leveraged to build better agents. Problems of large action spaces, partial observability, confounding bias, and uncertainty are only some of the problems he is actively researching. In his spare time Guy also enjoys creating mobile games, with the vision of incorporating AI into both the game development process and gameplay.",,

3,Semi-supervised Phenotyping with Electronic Health Records,Jesse Gronsbell | Chuan Hong | Molei Liu | Clara-Lea Bonzel | Aaron Sonabend,"
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Phenotyping is the process of identifying a patient’s health state based on the information in their electronic health records. In this tutorial, we will discuss why phenotyping is a challenging problem from both a practical and methodological perspective. We will focus primarily on the the challenges in obtaining annotated phenotype information from patient records and present statistical learning methods that leverage unlabeled examples to improve model estimation and evaluation to reduce the annotation burden.
    <br /><br />Jesse Gronsbell is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.  Prior to joining U of T,  Jesse spent a couple of years as a data scientist in the Mental Health Research and Development Group at Alphabet's Verily Life Sciences.  Her primary interest is in the development of statistical methods for modern digital data sources such as electronic health records and mobile health data.
    <br /><br />Chuan Hong is an instructor in biomedical informatics from the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at Harvard Medical School. She received her PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Her doctoral research focused on meta-analysis and DNA methylation detection. At DBMI, Chuan's research interests lie in developing statistical and computational methods for biomarker evaluation, predictive modeling, and precision medicine with biomedical data. In particular, she is interested in combining electronic medical records with biorepositories and relevant resources to improve phenotyping accuracy, detect novel biomarkers, and monitor disease progression in clinical research.
    <br /><br />Molei Liu is a 4th year PhD candidate in the Biostatistics department at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He received a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Peking University. Molei has been working in areas including high dimensional statistics, distributed learning, semi-supervised learning, semi-parametric inference, and model-X inference.

4,Experimental Design and Causal Inference Methods For Micro-Randomized Trials: A Framework for Developing Mobile Health Interventions,Tianchen Qian,"
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are providing new promising ways to deliver interventions in both clinical and non-clinical settings. Wearable sensors and smartphones collect real-time data streams that provide information about an individual’s current health including both internal (e.g., mood, blood sugar level) and external (e.g., social, location) contexts. Both wearables and smartphones can be used to deliver interventions. mHealth interventions are in current use across a vast number of health-related fields including medication adherence, physical activity, weight loss, mental illness and addictions. This tutorial discusses the micro-randomized trial (MRT), an experimental trial design for use in optimizing real time delivery of sequences of treatment, with an emphasis on mHealth. We introduce the MRT design using HeartSteps, a physical activity study, as an example. We define the causal excursion effect and discuss reasons why this effect is often considered the primary causal effect of interest in MRT analysis. We introduce statistical methods for primary and secondary analyses for MRT with continuous binary outcomes. We discuss the sample size considerations for designing MRTs.
    <br /><br />Tianchen Qian is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at University of California, Irvine. He completed his PhD at the Johns Hopkins University and was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. His research is focused on the experimental design and statistical analysis methods for developing mobile health interventions. In particular, he has developed causal inference methods for analyzing micro-randomized trial data and sample size calculation approaches for designing micro-randomized trials.
