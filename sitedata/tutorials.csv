1,Offline Reinforcement Learning,Guy Tennenholtz,"Guy Tennenholtz is a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Technion University, advised by Prof. Shie Mannor. His research interests lie in the field of reinforcement learning, and specifically, how offline data can be leveraged to build better agents. Problems of large action spaces, partial observability, confounding bias, and uncertainty are only some of the problems he is actively researching. In his spare time Guy also enjoys creating mobile games, with the vision of incorporating AI into both the game development process and gameplay.",,
2,Explainable ML: Understanding the Limits and Pushing the Boundaries,Hima Lakkaraju,"Hima Lakkaraju is an Assistant Professor at Harvard University focusing on explainability, fairness, and robustness of machine learning models. She has also been working with various domain experts in criminal justice and healthcare to understand the real world implications of explainable and fair ML. Hima has recently been named one of the 35 innovators under 35 by MIT Tech Review, and has received best paper awards at SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM) and INFORMS. She has given invited workshop talks at ICML, NeurIPS, AAAI, and CVPR, and her research has also been covered by various popular media outlets including the New York Times, MIT Tech Review, TIME, and Forbes.

3,Semi-supervised Phenotyping with Electronic Health Records,Jesse Gronsbell | Chuan Hong | Molei Liu | Clara-Lea Bonzel | Aaron Sonabend,"
    Jesse Gronsbell is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.  Prior to joining U of T,  Jesse spent a couple of years as a data scientist in the Mental Health Research and Development Group at Alphabet's Verily Life Sciences.  Her primary interest is in the development of statistical methods for modern digital data sources such as electronic health records and mobile health data.
    <br /><br />Chuan Hong is an instructor in biomedical informatics from the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at Harvard Medical School. She received her PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Her doctoral research focused on meta-analysis and DNA methylation detection. At DBMI, Chuan's research interests lie in developing statistical and computational methods for biomarker evaluation, predictive modeling, and precision medicine with biomedical data. In particular, she is interested in combining electronic medical records with biorepositories and relevant resources to improve phenotyping accuracy, detect novel biomarkers, and monitor disease progression in clinical research.
    <br /><br />Molei Liu is a 4th year PhD candidate in the Biostatistics department at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He received a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Peking University. Molei has been working in areas including high dimensional statistics, distributed learning, semi-supervised learning, semi-parametric inference, and model-X inference. He has also been working on methods for phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) using electronic health records data.
    <br /><br />Clara-Lea Bonzel is a research assistant at the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. She is mainly interested in personalized medicine using phenomic and genomic data, and model selection and evaluation.   Clara-Lea received her master's degree in Applied Mathematics and Financial Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL).
    <br /><br />Aaron Sonabend is a PhD candidate in the Biostatistics department at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He is primarily focused on developing robust reinforcement learning and natural language processing methods for contexts with sampling bias, partially observed rewards, or strong distribution shifts. He is interested in healthcare and biomedical applications, such as finding optimal sequential treatment regimes for complex diseases, and phenotyping using electronic health records. Aaron holds a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics, and in Economics from the National Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico (ITAM).
