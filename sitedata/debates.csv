He is also Section Head of Biomedical Informatics and Data Science and Deputy Director of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research. He received his undergraduate and medical training at Brown University, internal medicine residency at Dartmouth, and doctoral training in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Harvard.  He is Board Certified in Internal Medicine and Clinical Informatics, and an elected Fellow of the American College of Physicians, the American College of Epidemiology, HL7, the American Medical Informatics Association, and the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI), as well as a Founding Fellow of the International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics; he was president of ACMI 2017-18. He is an elected member of the Association of American Physicians. His career has focused on how we can represent clinical information to support analyses and inferencing, including comparative effectiveness analyses, decision support, best evidence discovery, and translational research.  He has had a deep interest in the semantic consistency of health data, harmonized information models, and ontology.  His current research focuses on translating basic science information to clinical practice, how we classify dysfunctional phenotypes (disease), and the harmonization and rendering of real-world clinical data including electronic health records to support data inferencing.  He became founding Chair of Biomedical Informatics at Mayo Clinic in 1988, retiring from Mayo in 2014, where he remains an emeritus Professor of Biomedical Informatics. He is presently PI on a spectrum of high-profile informatics grants from NIH spanning translational science including co-lead on the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). He has been active on many HIT standards efforts and chaired ISO Technical Committee 215 on Health Informatics and chaired the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Disease Revision (ICD-11).","",,
