{{ components.section("Sponsorship") }}

<p>Financial support ensures that ACM CHIL remains accessible to a broad set of participants by offseting the expenses involved in participation. We follow best practices in other ACM conferences to maintain a transparent and appropriate relationship with our funders:</p>

<ol>
<li>The substance and structure of the conference are determined independently by the program committees.</li>
<li>All papers are chosen through a rigorous, double-blind peer review process, where authors disclose conflicts of interest.</li>
<li>All sources of financial support are acknowledged.</li>
<li>Benefits are publicly disclosed below.</li>
<li>Corporate sponsors cannot specify how contributions are spent.</li>
<li>All attendees will be expected to follow the ACM Code of Conduct.</li>
</ol>
