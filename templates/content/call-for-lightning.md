The AHLI Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL) solicits work across a variety of disciplines, including machine learning, statistics, epidemiology, health policy, operations, and economics. CHIL 2023 invites abstracts for 5 minute lightning talks on the topic “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Better” that highlight machine learning in health failures that still surprise.  Specifically, authors are invited to submit 1 page abstracts (with unlimited pages for references).
Unconference Chairs will oversee the reviewing process.  If you are not sure if your submission fits the call, please reach out to the conference organizers (info@chilconference.org) for advice.

### Important Dates
- Submissions due: <s>Feb 28, 11:59 EST</s> Mar 15, 2023 11:59 PM EDT
- Author notification: April 3
- CHIL unconference: June 24 

### Evaluation
Works submitted to CHIL will be reviewed by at least 2 reviewers. Reviewers will be asked to primarily judge the work according to the following criteria:

Relevance: All submissions to CHIL are expected to be relevant to health. Concretely, this means that the problem is well-placed into the relevant themes for the conference. Reviewers will be able to recommend that submissions change tracks or flag submissions that are not suitable for the venue as a whole.

Quality: Is the submission technically sound? Are claims well supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results? Are the authors careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work?

Originality: Are the tasks or methods new? Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions? Is related work adequately cited? 

Clarity: Is the submission clearly written? Does it adequately inform the reader? 

Significance: Are the results important? Are others (researchers or practitioners) likely to use the ideas or build on them? Does the work highlight a failure that is truly surprising? 

Final decisions will be made by Unconference Chairs, taking into account reviewer comments, ratings of confidence and expertise, and our own editorial judgment.
