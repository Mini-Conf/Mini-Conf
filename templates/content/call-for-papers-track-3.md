## <center> Impact and Society:<br /> Policy, Public Health, and Social Outcomes </center>

<!-- ### Description -->
Algorithms do not exist in a vacuum: instead, they often explicitly aim for important social outcomes. This track considers issues at the intersection of algorithms and the societies they seek to impact, specifically for health. Submissions could include methodological contributions such as algorithmic development and performance evaluation for policy and public health applications, large-scale or challenging data collection, combining clinical and non-clinical data, as well as detecting and measuring bias. Submissions could also include impact-oriented research such as determining how algorithmic systems for health may introduce, exacerbate, or reduce inequities and inequalities, discrimination, and unjust outcomes, as well as evaluating the economic implications of these systems. We invite submissions tackling the responsible design of AI applications for healthcare and public health. System design for the implementation of such applications at scale is also welcome, which often requires balancing various tradeoffs in decision-making. Submissions related to understanding barriers to the deployment and adoption of algorithmic systems for societal-level health applications are also of interest. In addressing these problems, insights from social sciences, law, clinical medicine, and the humanities can be crucial.
