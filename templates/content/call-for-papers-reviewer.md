## <center> Reviewing for CHIL 2023

Reviewing is a critical service in any research community, especially for the vibrant and growing community on machine learning for health that we are all part of. Every submission deserves thoughtful, constructive feedback that both (1) identifies quality work worth highlighting at this venue and (2) helps authors improve their work for either this venue or a future publication.

Here we provide instructions for reviewers to help us achieve these goals, across the 4 distinct phases of reviewing (Bidding, Assignment, Review, and Discussion).

	- Skim abstracts and suggest >10 submissions you are interested in / qualified for
	- Estimated time commitment: 1 hour or less </s>
- Assignment period <s>(2/8 - 2/18)</s> (2/16 - 2/17)
	- Skim each of your assigned papers and report immediately
		- Formatting violations
		- Anonymity or Conflict of Interest violations 
		- Topics you are not qualified to review
	- Workload: 2-5 papers per reviewer
	- Estimated time commitment: 10 minutes per paper
- Review period <s>(2/8 - 3/3)</s> (2/17 - 3/14)
	- Deliver thoughtful review comments in timely fashion 
	- Workload: 2-5 papers per reviewer
	- Estimated time commitment: 2-5 hours per paper, spread out asynchronously
- Discussion period <s>(3/10 - 3/24)</s> (3/17 - 4/3)
	- Provide comments that respond to author feedback, other reviewers, and chairs
	- Workload: 2-5 papers per reviewer
	- Estimated time commitment: 1-2 hours per paper, spread out asynchronously


### <s><a name="bidding"></a>Bidding Period Instructions
After all submissions are received on Feb. 3, you (a CHIL reviewer) will have the opportunity to review submitted titles/abstracts within OpenReview and indicate which papers you are most qualified for and excited about. Bidding instructions will be provided via email.

Please bid promptly (by 2/7) and bid generously.</s>

### <a name="assignment"></a>Assignment Period Instructions
By 2/17, you (a CHIL reviewer) will be formally assigned 2-5 papers to review for CHIL.
We ask for each reviewer to promptly (within 10 days) skim their assigned papers to ensure:

- no violations of required formatting rules (page limits, margins, etc)
- no violations of anonymity (author names, institution names, github links, etc)
- sufficient expertise to review the paper

If you feel that you cannot offer an informed opinion about the quality of the paper due to expertise mismatch, please write to your assigned Area Chair on OpenReview ASAP. Because of the diverse interests and finite availability of the research community, we cannot always reassign reviewers, but chairs will do our best to make sure each submission has the most competent reviewers available in the pool.

### <a name="reviewing"></a>Reviewing Period Instructions
Between 2/17 and 3/14, you will be asked to complete thoughtful, constructive reviews for all assigned papers. Please make sure to complete your reviews by March 14th, 11:59 EST (earlier preferred). For each paper, you’ll fill out a form on OpenReview, similar to the form below:

#### Review format
1. Summary of the paper
	<ol type="a">
	  <li>Summarize \*your\* understanding of the paper. Stick to the facts: ideally, the authors should agree with everything written here.</li>
	</ol>
2. Strengths
	<ol type="a">
	  <li>Identify the promising aspects of the work.</li>
	</ol>
3. Weaknesses
	<ol type="a">
	  <li>Every paper that does not meet the bar for publication is the scaffolding upon which a better research idea can be built. If you believe the work is insufficient, help the authors see where they can take their work and how. </li>
	  <li>If you are asking for more experiments, elucidate clearly **why** you are recommending the authors consider an experiment as well as what **new** information your suggested experiment might shed on the proposed method. </li>
	</ol>
4. Questions for the authors
	<ol type="a">
	  <li>Communicate your potential misunderstandings of the work, to help authors craft a helpful and engaging response.</li>
	  <li>Be explicit about how responses to each of your questions might change your score for the paper. Prioritize questions that would lead to big potential score changes.</li>
	</ol>


#### Emergency Reviewing
To accommodate last minute emergencies, we will be seeking emergency reviewers for papers who do not receive all reviews by the deadline. Emergency reviewers will be sent a maximum of 3 papers by 3/15, and will need to write their reviews in a short time frame (between 3/15 and 3/18). Emergency review signup will be indicated in the reviewer signup form.

#### General Advice for preparing reviews
Follow the golden rule: be on time, provide polite and constructive reviews that you yourself would be happy to receive as an author. Be sure to review the paper, not the authors. When making statements about the paper, use phrases like “the paper proposes” rather than “the authors propose”. This makes your review less personal and separates critiques of the submission from critiques of the authors.

- Remember [Dennett's 4 rules for successful critical feedback](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/03/28/daniel-dennett-rapoport-rules-criticism/)
	- Especially, you should not give criticism without first acknowledging strengths and what you have learned from the submission.

If you are a junior reviewer, there is no harm in asking a senior mentor or colleague to provide you with feedback on your review (though do not breach confidentiality).


##### Track specific advice for preparing reviews for a CHIL submission

- Track 1: it is acceptable for a paper to use synthetic data to evaluate a proposed method. Not every paper must touch real health data, though all methods should be primarily motivated by health applications and the realism of the synthetic data is fair to critique
- Track 2: the contribution of this track should be either more focused on solving a carefully motivated problem grounded in applications or on deployments or datasets that enable exploration and evaluation of applications
- Track 3: meaningful contributions to this track can include a broader scope of contribution beyond algorithmic development. Innovative and impactful use of existing techniques is encouraged


### <a name="discussion"></a>Discussion and Consensus-Building Period Instructions
Between 3/20 and 4/3, you (a CHIL reviewer) will be expected to participate in discussions on OpenReview by reading the authors’ response and comments from other reviewers, adding additional comments from your perspective, and updating your review accordingly. 

We expect brief but thoughtful engagement from all reviewers here. For some papers, this would involve several iterations of feedback-response. A simplistic response of “I have read the authors’ response and I chose to keep my score unchanged” is not sufficient, because it does not provide detailed reasoning about what weaknesses are still salient and why the response is not sufficient. Please engage meaningfully!

Track Chairs will work with reviewers to try to reach a consensus decision about each paper by 4/3. In the event that consensus is not reached, Track Chairs make final decisions about acceptance.
