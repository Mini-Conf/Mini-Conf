The AHLI Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL) solicits work across a variety of disciplines at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare. CHIL 2024 invites submissions focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) techniques that address challenges in health, which we view broadly as including clinical healthcare, public health, population health, and beyond.

Specifically, authors are invited to submit 8-10 page papers (with unlimited pages for references) to one of 3 possible tracks: Models and Methods, Applications and Practice, or Impact and Society. Each track is described in detail below. Authors will select exactly one primary track when they register each submission, in addition to one or more sub-disciplines. Appropriate track and sub-discipline selection will ensure that each submission is reviewed by a knowledgeable set of reviewers. Track Chairs will oversee the reviewing process. In case you are not sure which track your submission fits under, feel free to contact the Track or Proceedings Chairs for clarification. The Proceedings Chairs reserve the right to move submissions between tracks if they believe that a submission has been misclassified.

<!-- For mode detail on the scope of each track, including examples of papers that would be suitable for each track, please refer to the track descriptions available at the top of this page. -->


<!-- ### Sub-Disciplines
These are called topics in the submission form. Authors should select one or more discipline(s) in machine learning for health (ML4H) from the following list when submitting their paper: benchmark datasets, distribution shift, transfer learning, population health, social networks, scalable ML4H systems, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, time series, bias/fairness, causality, *-omics, wearable-data, etc. Peer reviewers are assigned according to expertise in the sub-discipline(s) selected, so please choose your relevant topics carefully. -->

## Evaluation
Works submitted to CHIL will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. Reviewers will be asked to primarily judge the work according to the following criteria:

**Relevance**: Is the submission relevant to health, broadly construed? Does the problem addressed fall into the domains of machine learning and healthcare?

**Quality**: Is the submission technically sound? Are claims well supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results? Are the authors careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work? Is the work complete rather than a work in progress?

**Originality**: Are the tasks, methods and results novel? Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions? Is related work adequately cited to provide context? Does the submission contribute unique data, unique conclusions about existing data, or a unique theoretical or experimental approach?

**Clarity**:  Is the submission clearly written? Is it well-organized? Does it adequately provide enough information for readers to reproduce experiments or results?

**Significance**: Is the contribution of the work important? Are other researchers or practitioners likely to use the ideas or build on them? Does the work advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way?

Final decisions will be made by Track and Proceedings Chairs, taking into account reviewer comments, ratings of confidence and expertise, and our own editorial judgment. Reviewers will be able to recommend that submissions change tracks or flag submissions for ethical issues, relevance and suitability concerns.

<!-- ### Camera Ready
For accepted papers, authors will need to provide the following camera-ready materials by March 5:

- Metadata for the eRights system
- Submit forms for approval
- Final versions of papers
- Dual Submission Policy

You may not submit papers that are identical, or substantially similar to versions that are currently under review at another conference or journal, have been previously published, or have been accepted for publication. Submissions to the main conference are considered archival and will appear in the published proceedings of the conference if accepted.

An exception to this rule is extensions of workshop papers that have previously appeared in non-archival venues, such as workshops, arXiv, or similar without formal proceedings. These works may be submitted as-is or in an extended form. CHIL also welcomes full paper submission that extend previously published short papers or abstracts, so long as the previously published version does not exceed 4 pages in length. Note that the submission should not cite the workshop/report and preserve anonymity in the submitted manuscript. -->

## Submission Format and Guidelines
### Submission Site
Submissions should be made via the online submission system (**Coming soon!**). At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, attend, and present the work at the conference in order for the paper to appear in the conference proceedings.

<!-- Submissions should be made via the online submission system: [https://openreview.net/group?id=chilconference.org/CHIL/2022/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=chilconference.org/CHIL/2022/Conference). -->

### Length and Formatting
Submitted papers must be 8-10 pages (including all figures and tables). Unlimited additional pages can be used for references and additional supplementary materials (e.g. appendices). Reviewers will not be required to read the supplementary materials.

Authors are required to use the LaTeX template: [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/chil-2024-template/hvxrpckycnjm)

<!-- Authors are required to use the LaTeX template: [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EQc5RHHc5u7zdKhBCy1wIqwo0V0fGi-p/view?usp=sharing) or [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/chil-2023-template/yrwrrhnxsjwc). -->

**Required Sections** <br />
Similar to last year, two sections will be required: 1) Data and Code Availability, and 2) Institutional Review Board (IRB).

<u>Data and Code Availability</u>: This initial paragraph is **required**. Briefly state what data you use (including citations if appropriate) and whether the data are available to other researchers. If you are not sharing code, you must explicitly state that you are not making your code available. If you are making your code available, then at the time of submission for review, please include your code as supplemental material or as a code repository link; in either case, your code must be anonymized. If your paper is accepted, then you should de-anonymize your code for the camera-ready version of the paper. If you do not include this data and code availability statement for your paper, or you provide code that is not anonymized at the time of submission, then your paper will be desk-rejected. Your experiments later could refer to this initial data and code availability statement if it is helpful (e.g., to avoid restating what data you use).

<u>Institutional Review Board (IRB)</u>: This endmatter section is **required**. If your research requires IRB approval or has been designated by your IRB as Not Human Subject Research, then for the cameraready version of the paper, you must provide IRB information (and at the time of submission for review, you can say that this IRB information will be provided if the paper is accepted). If your research does not require IRB approval, then you must state this to be the case. This section does not count toward the paper page limit.

### Archival Submissions
Submissions to the main conference are considered archival and will appear in the published proceedings of the conference, if accepted. Author notification of acceptance will be provided by the listed date under Important Dates.

### Dual Submission Policy
You may not submit papers that are identical, or substantially similar to versions that are currently under review at another conference or journal, have been previously published, or have been accepted for publication. Submissions to the main conference are considered archival and will appear in the published proceedings of the conference if accepted.
An exception to this rule is extensions of workshop papers that have previously appeared in non-archival venues, such as workshops, arXiv, or similar without formal proceedings. These works may be submitted as-is or in an extended form. CHIL also welcomes full paper submissions that extend previously published short papers or abstracts, so long as the previously published version does not exceed 4 pages in length. Note that the submission should not cite the workshop/report and preserve anonymity in the submitted manuscript.
-->

### Preprint Submission Policy
Submissions to preprint servers (such as ArXiv or MedRxiv) are allowed while the papers are under review. While reviewers will be encouraged not to search for the papers, you accept that uploading the paper may make your identity known.


### Peer Review
The review process is mutually anonymous (aka “double blind”). Your submitted paper, as well as any supporting text or revisions provided during the discussion period, should be completely anonymized (including links to code repositories such as Github). Please do not include any identifying information, and refrain from citing the authors’ own prior work in anything other than third-person. Violations of this anonymity policy at any stage before final manuscript acceptance decisions may result in rejection without further review.

Conference organizers and reviewers are required to maintain confidentiality of submitted material. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be released prior to the conference.

You may not submit papers that are identical, or substantially similar to versions that are currently under review at another conference or journal, have been previously published, or have been accepted for publication. Submissions to the main conference are considered archival and will appear in the published proceedings of the conference if accepted.

An exception to this rule is extensions of workshop papers that have previously appeared in non-archival venues, such as workshops, arXiv, or similar without formal proceedings. These works may be submitted as-is or in an extended form, though they must follow our manuscript formatting guidelines. CHIL also welcomes full paper submissions that extend previously published short papers or abstracts, so long as the previously published version does not exceed 4 pages in length. Note that the submission should not cite the workshop/report and preserve anonymity in the submitted manuscript.

Upon submission, authors will select one or more relevant sub-discipline(s). Peer reviewers for a paper will be experts in the sub-discipline(s) selected upon its submission.

**Note:** Senior Area Chairs (AC) are prohibited from submitting manuscripts to their respective track. Area Chairs (AC) who plan to submit papers to the track they were assigned to need to notify the Track Senior Area Chair (AC) within 24 hours of submission.

### Open Access
CHIL is committed to open science and ensuring our proceedings are freely available.


### Responsible and Ethical Research
Computer software submissions should include an anonymized code link or code attached as supplementary material, licensing information, and provide documentation to facilitate use and reproducibility (e.g., package versions, README, intended use, and execution examples that facilitate execution by other researchers).

Submissions that include analysis on public datasets need to include appropriate citations and data sequestration protocols, including train/validation/test splits, where appropriate. Submissions that include analysis of non-public datasets need to additionally include information about data source, collection sites, subject demographics and subgroups statistics, data acquisition protocols, informed consent, IRB and any other information supporting evidence of adherence to data collection and release protocols.

Authors should discuss ethical implications and responsible uses of their work.
