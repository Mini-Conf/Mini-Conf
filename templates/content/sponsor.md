Financial support ensures that ACM-CHIL remains accessible to a broad set of participants by offsetting the expenses involved in participation. We follow best practices in other ACM conferences to maintain a transparent and appropriate relationship with our funders:

1. The substance and structure of the conference are determined independently by the program committees.
2. All papers are chosen through a rigorous, double-blind peer review process, where authors disclose conflicts of interest.
3. All sources of financial support are acknowledged.
4. Benefits are publicly disclosed below.
5. Corporate sponsors cannot specify how contributions are spent.
6. All attendees will be expected to follow the [ACM Code of Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics).
