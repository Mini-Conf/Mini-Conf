## <center> Applications and Practice:<br /> Investigation, Evaluation, Interpretation, and Deployment </center>



<!-- ### Description -->
The goal of this track is to highlight works applying robust methods, models, or practices to identify, characterize, audit, evaluate, or benchmark ML approaches to healthcare problems. Additionally, we welcome unique deployments and datasets used to empirically evaluate these systems are necessary and important to advancing practice. Whereas the goal of Track 1 is to select papers that show significant algorithmic novelty, submit your work here if the contribution is describing an emerging or established innovative application of ML in healthcare. Areas of interest include but are not limited to:

- Datasets and simulation frameworks for addressing gaps in ML healthcare applications
- Tools and platforms that facilitate integration of AI algorithms and deployment for healthcare applications
- Innovative ML-based approaches to solving a practical problems grounded in a healthcare application
- Surveys, benchmarks, evaluations and best practices of using ML in healthcare
- Emerging applications of AI in healthcare

Introducing a new method is not prohibited by any means for this track, but the focus should be on the extent of how the proposed ideas contribute to addressing a practical limitation (e.g., robustness, computational scalability, improved performance). We encourage submissions in both more traditional clinical areas (e.g., electronic health records (EHR), medical image analysis),  as well as in emerging fields (e.g., remote and telehealth medicine, integration of omics).

<!-- Computer software submissions should describe the intended use for the software, justify the need for the software, and provide executable examples for other researchers. Software submissions should directly support a healthcare application. Examples include code for summarizing the demographics of a study cohort, deriving meaningful clinical concepts from electronic health records, and natural language processing tools specifically designed for clinical text. All computer software submissions must be open source and released under a suitable open source license. Computer software should adhere to best practices in software development where possible, including the use of unit tests, continuous integration, and diligent documentation of component design and purpose. -->

<!-- We welcome submissions from a wide variety of perspectives, including but not limited to: examination of robustness of ML systems to real-world dataset shift or adversarial shift, scalable and safe machine learning/inference in clinical environments, new ML tools or comprehensive benchmarks for healthcare, development of scalable systems for processing data in practice, bridging the deployment gap, remote, wearable, and telehealth, data or software packages.

Upon submission, authors will select one or more relevant sub-discipline(s). Peer reviewers for a paper will be experts in the sub-discipline(s) selected upon its submission. -->
