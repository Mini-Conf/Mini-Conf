### Description
Advances in machine learning are critical for a better understanding of health. This track seeks contributions in modeling, inference, and estimation in health-focused or health-inspired settings. We welcome submissions that develop novel methods and algorithms, introduce relevant machine learning tasks and baselines, identify challenges with prevalent approaches, or suggest new evaluation metrics for assessing algorithmic advances. In addition, we welcome new algorithmic techniques for combining non-clinical and clinical data for public and population health applications, algorithms for public health goals, and causal inference in public health settings.

While submissions should address problems relevant to health, the contributions themselves are not required to be directly applied to health. For example, authors may use synthetic datasets and experiments to demonstrate the properties of algorithms.

We welcome submissions that address research questions within any subfield of machine learning, broadly construed. The list of subfields below represent some areas of relevance we have identified in advance, but we do welcome submissions from other subfields as well.

Authors may consider one or more machine learning sub-discipline(s) from the following list: causal inference, time series, unsupervised learning, representation learning, survival analysis, natural language processing, knowledge graphs, deep learning architectures, Bayesian learning, inference, structured learning, computer vision, supervised learning, transfer learning, robust learning, domain adaptation or generalization and evaluation methods. Authors may also consider sub-disciplines not listed here.

Upon submission, authors will select one or more relevant sub-discipline(s). Peer reviewers for a paper will be experts in the sub-discipline(s) selected upon its submission, so please select your relevant disciplines judiciously.
