<!-- ### Description -->
Advances in machine learning are critical for a better understanding of health. This track seeks technical contributions in modeling, inference, and estimation in health-focused or health-inspired settings. We welcome submissions that develop novel methods and algorithms, introduce relevant machine learning tasks, identify challenges with prevalent approaches, or learn from multiple sources of data (e.g. non-clinical and clinical data).

Our focus on health is broadly construed, including clinical healthcare, public health, and population health. While submissions should be primarily motivated by problems relevant to health, the contributions themselves are not required to be directly applied to real health data. For example, authors may use synthetic datasets to demonstrate properties of their proposed algorithms.

We welcome submissions from many perspectives, including but not limited to supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, causal inference, representation learning, survival analysis, domain adaptation or generalization, interpretability, robustness, and algorithmic fairness. All kinds of health-relevant data types are in scope, including tabular health records, time series, text, images, videos, knowledge graphs, and more. We welcome all kinds of methodologies, from deep learning to probabilistic modeling to rigorous theory and beyond.
