The AHLI CHIL 2023 Doctoral Symposium is an opportunity for PhD students to broadcast their research and get feedback on their directions from CHIL attendees and leaders in the field. Participants will present their ongoing and/or future doctoral dissertation work as both a 5 minute lightning presentation and as a poster, encouraging cross-pollination of ideas with senior leaders and CHIL participants. In addition to the lightning talks and poster session, participants will have facilitated opportunities to connect with and meet established researchers one-on-one throughout the conference. The Doctoral Symposium will be held on June 24, 2023 in Cambridge, MA, United States.
