## ACM-CHIL 2021

The ACM Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL), targets a cross-disciplinary representation of clinicians and researchers (from industry and academia) in machine learning, health policy, causality, fairness, and other related areas.

ACM CHIL 2021 will be a virtual conference building on the success of the inaugural CHIL conference held digitally in July 2020, as well as the ML4H Unconference, held in Toronto, and the Machine Learning for Health Workshop at NeurIPS, held in Vancouver. The conference is designed to spark insight-driven discussions on new and emerging ideas that may lead to collaboration and discussion.

All ACM CHIL events and communications must abide by the [ACM policy against discrimination and harassment](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment). Violations of this policy should be reported [directly to the ACM](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/reporting-unacceptable-behavior), copying the event chairs.
